PERMERGO DAO
Description
Perma-Ergo is a realfi project that seeks to employ Ergo blockchain technology in holistic natural systems known as: Permaculture or Agroecology, through means of giving micro loans to farmers who neither have access to either farmlands nor the financial means to give them accessibility to land to cultivate, forming a vicious cycle spiraling to exclusion and poverty. Eventually the end goal of Perma-Ergo is to encourage: Real World Food Production Decentralisation.
Introduction
Permaculture and blockchain are analogous. Permaculture aims to create ecosystems that are self-sustaining and decentralised from government clutches through the following :
- Food Production.
- Water Catchment and Aquaponic Systems.
- Soil Production.
- Waste recycling.
- Regenerative closed systems.

Blockchain seeks to create a decentralised financial system where people own their own money. Blockchain has gone way beyond Bitcoin since it’s inception, and now thanks to smart contracts and decentralised finance we can finally visualise business start-ups in places that have historically been excluded from access to finance in order to initiate and transact trade on all levels. Suffice to say that on the African continent a lot of countries face disproportianately high interest rates for taking loans making it very difficult to have access to finance through traditional financial banks.
Farmers sometimes lack basic stocking tools in order to stock their yield which forces them to sell their crops cheaply if not with a loss in order for them to have money, while if they could have a loan, it will help them buy the special stocking bags needed to store their crops for an extended period of six months, then they could make 2x profit on their crops.
Here offers  Ergo blockchain a possible solution.
Just as Blockchain technology has smart contracts and defi, Permaculture design principles ensure the creation of an ecosystem that will lead to decentralisation in Food Producation.
False problems we are led to believe
The statement that overpopulation is the problem causing a lot of stress on the planet is inherently false if not misleading. 
The problem in our opinion is that since a century our historical lifestyle have been fundemantally changed towards the creation of mass consumption societies, thus we shifted from local communities that relied heavily on cooperation locally when it comes to production to mass populations living a rat race in heavily polluted complicated societies and mega cities : That in our opinion is the root cause of the whole problem on the planet. Humanity has been misled by mass media control and systems that led them astray from connecting with the planet biologically and therefore now we are faced with a huge problem concerning food and water shortages because of the centralisation and the fact that normal people have lost the connection and the know-how to produce food through cooperation and the cultivation of soil and earth, relying heavily on traditional supply chain global systems, where a mango in Brussels in the month of December cost less than a mango in its climate in Rwanda because of shark financial practices against farmers and because of mass monocultural production that harms Earth and impovrishes the soil for our future generation.
Given the right practices we can focus the global energy into the restauration of our ancient practices and restauring the old patterns through applying decentralised disruptive technologies. So the more decentralised we are globally the better for our planet and therefore the argument of overpopulation is false. There is a lot of abundance on the planet than scarcity but we need the right tools with the right intentions to canalise these efforts into the real world : this can only happen with the cooperation of our community as a whole : Ergo poses as a strong candidate to host Perma-Ergo because of its vision, manifesto and community.
I’d like to use the following quote from a TedTalk entitled Gangster Gardener documenting community efforts in South Central L.A.
« Growing your own food is like printing your own money »
Informal finance as substitute to formal finance
This is especially very important for the global south where people are excluded from economic, and thus social participation, this is also a pressing issue for minorities, migrants and transmigrants in the developed North, but our project seeks to solve the problem of exclusion from its root not the branches. The problem starts in the global South and because of the dysfunctionality of our current system the problem falls like a snowball. By the time it reaches a low it becomes very huge and takes multiple forms: cultural, religious, social, and communitarian tensions to name the least and of course (dysfunctional) governments and state find a raison d’être to further clamp down hard on simple people under the guise of control and order.
Here comes Informal finance as the solution for this reality that we witness. Informal finance is down-down solution without waiting for the bureaucratic invasive intervention of governments and states: by micro financing projects related to food production, we are simply going back to what we have always been doing since the dawn of humanity: cultivating land, it’s litteraly the reason why civilization started.
Another reason why informal finance is key to solving this problem is because most of normal people don’t know how to interact and use the tools of formal financing because either they lack the right tools to write a project, and so the very first step needs a help and here we usually see big bureaucratic NGOs that eventually doesn’t solve the problem but on the contrary they only keep the status quo going.
Ergo, its community and ecosystem could be the launchpad for this small but promising realfi project.
Permergo Roadmap
    • Q1 2023 Kickstarting Permergo DAO on Ergo blockchain.
    • Q2-Q3 2023 Starting negotiations with authorities in Zanzibar to start up a non profit organisation that will allow for the functioning on the terrain.
    • Q2-Q3 2023 Creating a Permergo website.

Lending and Borrowing
- Building and setting up of the website.
- Realfi projects will be funded with micro loans through the Permergo platform website.
- Collatorized vs Non-Collatorized loans to be decided by the team on the ground.

Partnering with projects

Permergo will be active on the ground as well, in the real world. We in Permergo believe in the shared experience in contrast to impersonal experiences, we envision a future where we spend a healthy amount of time in the real world.
Partnership of Permergo with local farmers in case the vision needs maturing until the lender is able of standing on her or his feet independently in the project.
We aspire to partner with other platforms on the Ergo blockchain : Eventually it could become possible to initiate loan demands on lending and borowing platforms of the Ergo ecosystems and then making it liquid through Permergo on the ground.
Our concept hopes to create long lasting partnerships that can take us to different levels of efficiency in the world through Proof-Of-Work (POW)
